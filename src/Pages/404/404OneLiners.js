  "A Wildebeest stampede came through and wiped out the museum that was holding the story. We are currently in the process of tying balloons to each of the wildebeests to send them home. However, we are running into a mathematical error. Apparently one balloon is not in fact strong enough to lift a wildebeest. Captain Code and our mathematicians are on the scene problem solving. More info to come. \nMany apologies.",
  "Over the years we have tried multiple forms of advertising, our most recent venture involved a telephone pole, three thousand staples, and some hand drawn posters, which we would be showing here. But as you can see, despite the copious amount of staples used, all the posters have flown away. \nMy gargantuan apologies.",
  "Our office building is constantly rearranging itself, so the office that was here is now over in the gym, and the gym is in the kitchen, and the tennis team is currently using all the apples as balls. Perfect for slicing candy apples, bad for business.\nMy most prevalent condolences.",
  "Lionel The Loathesome melted the iceberg our story was being kept on. We currently have Choppers in the air, Gladice and her crew are laying down canon fire, and the aviators are on stand-by. Please forgive us, as we are unsure if the page will ever be found. \nMy high altitude apologies.",
  "The resident site weevils are swarming currently, an exterminator has been called. All should be well soon.\nA round of apologies.",
  "The most recent of the Aviantors flying spectacles has blown all our paper everywhere. We are in the process of picking it up. If you happen to see some ants flying around in a paper airplane, please tell them to leave us alone. \nMy aeropologies.",
  "A dense fog has covered our workshop. We have every available unit fanning, but it may be a while.\nMy nearly mist apologies.",
  "Captain Code sneezed and accidently put this part of the site a few miles down the road. Gimme a minute, I’ll go get it. \nA marathon of apologies. ",
  "It exploded… Just got the glue and duct tape. Give me a little while to put this back together.\nMy puzzling apologies.",
