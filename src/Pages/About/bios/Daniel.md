FostyWally spends the bulk of his days sailing the virtual seas, exploring the
different nooks and crannies that have never been explored, and talking to
interesting people all over the world. He is searching for _the_ story, a story
so majestic it would make a rhino do a backflip. He has yet to find this story,
but one day he will find it, and share it with all the world through the Bedtime
Project.
